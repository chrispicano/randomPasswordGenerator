# randomPasswordGenerator 
For this project i have effectively made a random password generator using HTML,CSS, and javascript components. Using javasript, I was able to create some prompts for custom personalization of the password, for instances if you'd like the password to contain an uppercase, lower case, number, or special symbol. This is great for employees and employers who have to follow a certain security criteria.
